An employed person can opt for a PPF but a self-employed person cannot opt for an EPF. PPF allows contributions to be made 12 times a year subject to a minimum amount of Rs 100. The EPF does offer higher interest rates at 8.75% p.a. but the PPF only offers interest of 8.70% p.a. The PPF has higher loan options that allows withdrawal of up to 50% of the balance starting either from the 4th year or the 6th year onwards. EPF is more long term and is to be invested for a period till retirement or resignation whereas the PPF has a mandatory 15 year period and can be renewed for 5 year terms after that. PPF amounts cannot be used for paying off debts but can be used for cases of income tax evasion.
